[**3D C++ Game: World of Champloo**](http://youchaosdevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/02/world-of-champloo.html)  
Our team with 2 programmers and 3 artists developed this game with split screen version(using XBOX controller) and networking
version in less than 2 months in 2008 using OGRE3D for 3D rendering engine, Physx for Physics engine, OpenAL for game audio, CEGUI 
for ingame GUI, Raknet for UDP networking communication.


[**3D Game Editor for OGRE3D Engine with .net**](http://youchaosdevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/03/few-videos-show-my-editor.html)  
My personal side project including the following features:  
Visual studio style dockable .net window for rendering multiple 3D scene, editor layout load/save from/to xml files  
3D scene, model animations serialization/deserialization to/from XML files  
All the properties can be configured through unified .net property grid etc.
