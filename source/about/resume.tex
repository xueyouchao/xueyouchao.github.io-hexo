\subsubsection[technical-skills]{Technical Skills}

{\bf C/C++98 && C++11}\crlf
Deep understanding of C/C++ language including object oriented design,
c++ tempate programming, template metaprogramming, multithreading
programming, c++11 new memory model for concurrency programming and
lock-free programming.

{\bf Java & Objective C}\crlf
Performed Java source code review for several top 500 corporation Java
server side projects as well as Android and iOS mobile client side code
(or hybrid client using webview such as Cordova). Focused on web/mobile
security domain, familiar with major J2EE framework such as Struts2,
Spring framework; understanding of Java concurrency model, low level
multi-threading messaging library LMax Disruptor.

{\bf C\# & .net language}\crlf
Strong skill on c\# programming with experience on developing several
c\# based projects mixed with P/Invoke native funcations.Familiar with
c\# async programming and multithreading programming. Experience on
developing projects using c++/cli mixed with native c++ to bring .net UI
to native c++ code.

{\bf Other languages}\crlf
Strong interest on concurrency programming; although mainly focus on
c++11 concurrency programming, I also developed security analysis tool
using Golang based on its CSP model. Knowledge of different concurrency
approaches including SIMD, multithreading,functional programming, Actor,
CSP, GPGPU etc.

{\bf Developing Environment}\crlf
Emacs on Manjaro Linux and Visual Studio + Visual Assist X on Windows
Current write c++ project using

python binding) or GENie(https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie)(Lua based
premake), the tool helps to generate and compiles c++ code base cross
multiple compilers and cross different OS platforms including Windows,
Linux, OSX, iOS, Android, asm.js/Emscripten(superior web browser
solution), PNaCl etc. Familiar with various version control including
github, magit(github in emacs),bitbucket, Tortoise SVN, Microsoft Team
Foundation Server etc.
