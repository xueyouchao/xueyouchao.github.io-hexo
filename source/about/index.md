    Deep understanding of C/C++ language including object oriented design,
    c++ tempate programming, template metaprogramming, multithreading programming,
    c++11 new memory model for concurrency programming and lock-free programming.

**Java & Objective C**  
    Performed Java source code review for several top 500 corporation Java server side projects as well as
    Android and iOS mobile client side code (or hybrid client using webview such as Cordova). Focused on web/mobile 
    security domain, familiar with major J2EE framework such as Struts2, Spring framework; understanding of Java concurrency
    model, low level multi-threading messaging library LMax Disruptor.

**C# & .net language**  
    Strong skill on c# programming with experience on developing several c# based projects mixed with P/Invoke native
    funcations.Familiar with c# async programming and multithreading programming. Experience on developing projects 
    using c++/cli mixed with native c++ to bring .net UI to native c++ code.

**Other languages**  
    Strong interest on concurrency programming; although mainly focus on c++11 concurrency programming, I
    also developed security analysis tool using Golang based on its CSP model. Knowledge of 
    different concurrency approaches including SIMD, multithreading,functional programming, Actor, CSP, GPGPU etc.
    
**Developing Environment**  
    Emacs on Manjaro Linux and Visual Studio + Visual Assist X on Windows
    Current write c++ project using [Fips](http://floooh.github.io/fips/getstarted.html)(cmake's python binding)
    or GENie(https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie)(Lua based premake), the tool helps to generate and compiles c++ 
    code base cross multiple compilers and cross different OS platforms including Windows, Linux, OSX, iOS, Android,
    asm.js/Emscripten(superior web browser solution), PNaCl etc. Familiar with various version control including
    github, magit(github in emacs),bitbucket, Tortoise SVN, Microsoft Team Foundation Server etc.

### Personal Side Projects

[**3D C++ Game: World of Champloo**](http://youchaosdevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/02/world-of-champloo.html)  
Our team with 2 programmers and 3 artists developed this game with split screen version(using XBOX controller) and networking
version in less than 2 months in 2008 using OGRE3D for 3D rendering engine, Physx for Physics engine, OpenAL for game audio, CEGUI 
for ingame GUI, Raknet for UDP networking communication.


[**3D Game Editor for OGRE3D Engine with .net**](http://youchaosdevelopment.blogspot.com/2009/03/few-videos-show-my-editor.html)  
My personal side project including the following features:  
Visual studio style dockable .net window for rendering multiple 3D scene, editor layout load/save from/to xml files  
3D scene, model animations serialization/deserialization to/from XML files  
All the properties can be configured through unified .net property grid etc.
