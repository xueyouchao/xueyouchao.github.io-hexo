I have switched my programming environment to Manjaro Linux recently. So I started to give a try on legendary editor Emacs for development. I started with zero basics for Emacs and spent only 2 week's spare time to get used to writing code and blog with it.

## Quick start from giants' shoulders
* Do not blindly start to learn Emacs commands or lisp language, learning without helping you to achieve your goal will make you give up soon. You should start from guru's setup to achieve what you want to do and learn the commands and everyting along the way.
* I started by taking advice from Chen Bin [(git:redguardtoo)]("https://github.com/redguardtoo"). Quickly read his post ["mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide"](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide).
* Followed the recommendation, I spent a little time going through the emacs tutorial. ThenI downloaded his [configuration](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d) to play around.
* Very importantly, write down the important steps, as a proper plugin based editor, when you made so many customizations to emacs you want to make sure write down the steps.

## Explore the World of Emacs
* So many good things guru's has setup for you. Try it.  
Spent half an hour to learn basics of Org Mode and play with M-Org-Indent-Mode in Chen's setup. You can write down the steps using org-indent-mode as I did.
